Project Title: SFO Air Cargo Analysis

Date: 11 Jan 2026

**Problem Statement**
The objective is to analyze air traffic cargo statistics at SFO in order to:

Identify seasonal trends from 2015 to 2025 and YoY analysis
Compare cargo volumes across airlines, regions/route, and aircraft types to uncover operational inefficiencies or competitive advantages.
Provide recommendations for airport authorities, airlines, and logistics stakeholders to optimize cargo handling capacity.
These can enhance airport resource allocation, airline scheduling, and supply chain resilience, ultimately supporting more efficient global trade through SFO.
